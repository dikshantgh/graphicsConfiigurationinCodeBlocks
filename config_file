As Code Block by default doesn't have "graphics.h". So, I followed One tutorial tom setup graphics.h in Code Block which has the following steps.

1. Download TDM GCC 32 bit
https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/download/

2. Download library files
https://drive.google.com/file/d/16xZBvFXf7yFjxwTpuyevK1KPuLgUeZFh/view

3. After extraction put "graphics.h" & "winbgim.h" in "C:\tdm\include

4. "libbgi.a" in "C:\Program Files\tdm\lib\" folder

5. Setting -> Compiler -> Global compiler setting
.under "Link Libraries" section add
"C:\tdm\lib\lib.a"
change toolchain settigs to point to tdm folder

6. under "Other linker options" section add
-lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32

7. Open "graphics.h" from "C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\MinGW\include" in notepad and jump to line 302 and edit it to

int left=0, int top=0, int right=INT_MAX, int bottom=INT_MAX,
