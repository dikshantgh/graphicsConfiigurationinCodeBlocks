As Code Block by default doesn't have "graphics.h". So, I followed One tutorial tom setup graphics.h in Code Block which has the following steps.

1. Download "WinBGIm_Library6_0_Nov2005.rar" from http://winbgim.codecutter.org/

2. After extraction put "graphics.h" & "winbgim.h" in "C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\MinGW\include" folder

3. "libbgi.a" in "C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\MinGW\lib" folder

4. Setting -> Compiler -> Global compiler setting
5.under "Link Libraries" section add
"C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\MinGW\include"

6. under "Other linker options" section add
-lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32

7. Open "graphics.h" from "C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\MinGW\include" in notepad and jump to line 302 and edit it to

int left=0, int top=0, int right=INT_MAX, int bottom=INT_MAX,
